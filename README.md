# Eye-Movement

## Description
This is a programming exercise for creating two animated eyeballs on the screen. Each eyeball is programmed to follow the user's mouse pointer as it moves across the screen. A basic version, showing the basic requirements for this exercise, which forces both eyes to move dependently of, or in exact positional synchronicity with, each other.
## Installation / Usage
Download all of the files within this repository, and load the index.html file in a web browser. This app can run while hosted either locally or on a remote web server. For a live preview, you can run the index.html file in this repo.
## Roadmap
I would potentially like to add the eyes to an animal and/or person to make it more realistic.
