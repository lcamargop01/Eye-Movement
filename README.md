# Eye-Movement

## Project Description
This is a programming exercise for creating two animated eyeballs on the screen. Each eyeball is programmed to follow the user's mouse pointer as it moves across the screen. A basic version, showing the basic requirements for this exercise, which forces both eyes to move dependently of, or in exact positional synchronicity with, each other.

## How to Run
(1) Download all files from the master branch of this repository into a directory on your local machine 
<ul>
  <li> index.html </li>
  <li> eyes.js </li>
  <li> styles.css </li>
</ul>
(2) Open index.html in browser (Google Chrome provides best results)

## Roadmap
I would potentially like to add the eyes to an animal and/or person to make it more realistic. Also, it would be cool to see a cross-eyed view.
